# Tutorial

In this tutorial we design a simple tensile net in the shape of a hypar, following a 5-step procedure.

1. Create a mesh surface with quadrilateral faces (i.e. a quad mesh).
2. Fix the corner vertices of the mesh (vertices with ``degree = 2``).
3. Move two of the corner vertices to an elevated position.
4. Scale the force densities of one of the boundaries.
5. Constrain one of the vertices to a line.

After steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, we compute the resulting equilibrium shape.
